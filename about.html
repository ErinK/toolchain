          <div class="col2">
            <p>When Benjy was ten years old, his uncle showed him the latest gadget: a Sinclair ZX80. It was the 8-bit wonder of the time, with its 3 MHz processor and 1KB of RAM. That was the first time Benjy saw a computer but by the end of a week learning BASIC, he knew they would play a major role in his life.</p>
            <p>Although originally from the UK, Benjy grew up in Israel where an ongoing fascination with computers translated to undergraduate and graduate Computer Science studies at Hebrew University.</p>
            <p>Benjy has worked as a software engineer for over 20 years. He cut his teeth on C++ and low-level network programming before working on distributed systems at Google and Twitter. While at Foursquare, he led the infrastructure engineering team. Benjy has been a core contributor to the Pants open-source build system since its inception, and was instrumental in turning it into a true OSS project supported by a growing community.</p>

          <div class="col2">
            <p>John's early interest in programming began by drawing with Logo on an Apple II, and then trying to create games in the Zork style. Although not eaten by a Grue, he moved away from programming, developing a deep interest in physics. After two years of mentoring a FIRST Robotics Competition team, he was drawn back into coding.</p>
            <p>John has many years of experience in software engineering. He worked on the Google Docs team with a focus on storage APIs. Later, he worked on early PaaS efforts at VMware which led to a turn at Twitter building out Mesos/Aurora with focuses on distributed storage systems and consensus algorithms. Along the way, he worked on the "Who To Follow" service. While at Twitter, John started the Pants build system project, and continues to be a core contributor to this day.</p>

            <p>Tansy left a life of equine massage, organic dairy cows, and climbing trees with chainsaws in New Zealand when a vacation to New York inspired a career change. She'd always been interested in programming, but only got serious after encountering Code for America and realizing just how powerful programming is as a tool for effecting change.</p>
            <p>While at Foursquare, Tansy discovered a love for building things that make everyone else more productive and less frustrated. She works on build tools because she loves solving interesting problems and contributing incredible projects.</p>
            <p>Tansy has been a contributor to the Pants system for the past two years.</p>
