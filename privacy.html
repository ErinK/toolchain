          <h4>Our Policy:</h4>
          
          <p>Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of Toolchain Labs, Inc. ("Toolchain Labs", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Toolchain Labs and has been created to provide information about our company and the services we offer, including our hosted, distributed software build system (together with the Site, the "Services") to our Service visitors and users ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.</p>
          
          <h4>Information We Collect:</h4>
          
          <p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you as described herein and when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to the Services or contact us with inquiries.</p>
          
          <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Toolchain Labs and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</strong></p>
          
          <h3>Other Information:</h3>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong> When you interact with Toolchain Labs through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. We may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Toolchain Labs' affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.</p>
          
          <p class="indent">In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features. </p>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we often conduct research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregated and/or de-identified basis, and we may share this aggregated and/or de-identified data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregated and/or de-identified information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated and/or de-identified user statistics and other metrics related to our Services in order to describe our products or services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Analytics and Tracking Technologies:</strong>  We may, and we may allow third party service providers to, use cookies (as noted above) or other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Site. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Site. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</p>
          
          <p class="indent">Our Site currently does not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          
          <h4>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h4>
          
          <p>We use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Toolchain Labs and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. Toolchain Labs and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
          
          <p>Certain other ways we may use your Personal Data are as follows:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>To administer a survey.</li>
            <li>To troubleshoot problems with the Services.</li>
            <li>To enforce our Terms of [Use/Service], and to detect and protect against error, fraud and other unauthorized or illegal activities.</li>
            <li>To provide any legitimate business service or product.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h4>
          
          <p>Toolchain Labs is not in the business of selling your information.  There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: </p>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> We, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
          
          <p class="indent"><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Toolchain Labs, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>
          
          <h4>Your Choices:</h4>
          
          <p>You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services.</p>
          
          <h4>Exclusions:</h4>
          
          <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by us other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>

          <h4>Children:</h4>
          
          <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to us through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

          <h4>Links to Other Web Sites:  </h4>
          
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Toolchain Labs endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>

          <h4>Integrating Log-In Platforms: </h4>
          
          <p>One of the features of the Service is that it allows you to enable or log in to the Services via certain third party services, such as GitHub, using federated login technology such as OAuth ("Log-In Platform(s)").  By directly integrating these services, we help streamline your online experience. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to log into or grant us permission via the relevant Log-In Platform. When you log into the Service using a Log-In Platform, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service, as well as your data contained within that Log-In Platform and/or corresponding sites or services.  As part of such integration, the Log-In Platform will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such Log-In Platform and/or corresponding sites or services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  However, please remember that the manner in which the Log-In Platforms use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and we shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Log-In Platform that may be enabled within the Service.</p>

          <h4>Security:</h4>
          
          <p>We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the Internet. </p>

          <h4>Other Terms and Conditions:</h4>
          
          <p>Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the Terms of [Use/Service] at <a href="terms.html">https://toolchain.com/terms.html</a></p>

          <p>The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.</p>
